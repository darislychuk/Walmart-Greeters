Meg Comments on Engineering Website

1. Current and respective students are the primary goal, international/domestic

2. Graduate students decided on where to continue their studies. Research/interesting?

3. People interested in collaborating with other faculty members/similar work trying to assist in faculty work

Layout should be somewhat similar to main website with good flow(consistent/continuity)

Intuitive and info easy to find/obvious/clear header to help navigate

Keeping all info current, perhaps linking stuff that applies to the u of r entirely

Trevor

Website is the face to the world(first place people look for our program info)

Dead links are very bad

All departments in Engineering need to be consistent(branded well)

Required courses(should have instead of having to go to the main engineering site)

Social media (Link to github on FB)

Exact classes we have to offer and link to course calendar desc.
